            The world needs a bit of everything - Innovative solutions, 
            brilliant and dedicated minds that are willing to learn and 
            grow together. So I started using my artistic skills 
            combined with multimedia design training and I ended up 
            exploring different avenues like UX & UI, web design, 
            video editing, animation, etc. I've listed below a few of my recent projects, 
            some individual and some teamwork.

                 This scroller website was a playfull atempt to have some fun with

                 trend if you want to create something more interactive and fun for 
                 the user. As I have a collection of flowers and a saturated video to 
                 work with, why not go all the way and bring the full atmospheric effect?

                  modern online presence for an emerging visual artist and
                  tattoo apprentice in London was successful and resulted in
                  this beautifull website that is awaiting further development.
                  This is an ongoing process as the artist evolves and expands.

                 On the Hacked Hogwarts we had to create a studentlist that would contain all the 
                 houses, like Griffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff & Ravenclaw, from the Harry Potter theme. Here, I worked with a lot of Javascript
                 to extract the data from the backend Hogwarts server. All styling done with CSS and Javascript. 
                 <a href="Imgs/multimedia/11C.04.04 - Hacked Hogwarts Student List.pdf">Here</a> is how I created the studentlist from scratch.

                  to look back at previouse work to remind yourself that you're
                  constantly growing. I wanted to have a place where I could store all my projects from 
                  the 1st semester of university, you could call it a - tryout website journal!

                 Our task was to analyse the already existing Fronter app for bugs and 
                 problems and fix the design solutions and come up with amazing ideas in the group. 
                 As a method we used the 5 day sprint to increase our workflow and have everything ready on time.

                  variables. I added a vector drawing I made to test it out, and it seems to work! 
                  I am looking forward to explore new avenues in working with JS as well as variables and drawings.

                  using Google sheets to store our data. Then we had to extract the data using Javascript.
                  I worked on the styling of the website as well as creating the quiz. All in all, I did a bit of
