            The world needs a bit of everything - Innovative solutions, 
            brilliant and dedicated minds that are willing to learn and 
            grow together. So I started using my artistic skills 
            combined with multimedia design training and I ended up 
            exploring different avenues like UX & UI, web design, 
            video editing, animation, etc. I've listed below a few of my recent projects,

                  Last weekend, I completed the hackathon challenge (23rd - 25th October 2020) conducted by TH.0 - ClimaTH.On. 
                  What a rush!
In 48 hours, my team and I brought our idea to life as a prototype. An app called PariCO¬≤ that pairs with a sensor to help monitor PM2.5 
and educate users about air pollution in order to help reduce their carbon footprint.
I‚Äôm so proud of my team as we all worked so hard, giving our best effort to complete 
this challenge, and as a result we were collectively awarded 3rd place in the competition!

                 On the Hacked Hogwarts we had to create a studentlist that would contain all the

                 to extract the data from the backend Hogwarts server. All styling done with CSS and Javascript.

                  This is a digital coloring book project, that I really liked! I am working on producing 
                  a big scale illustration for this project. This was made mostly using Javascript and Css 
                  variables. I added a vector drawing I made to test it out, and it seems to work! 
                  I am looking forward to explore new avenues in working with JS as well as variables and drawings. 
                  Click on a color then color inside the lines, as you would on paper.

                  Here, we worked as a group for an assignment called "common interest". We choose 
                  Disney Characters, since we have a big target group for them. We were required to work
                  using Google sheets to store our data. Then we had to extract the data using Javascript.
                  I worked on the styling of the website as well as creating the quiz. All in all, I did a bit of 
                  everything. We ended up with a great project!

                 This is a UI & UX design for an alternative improved version of Fronter, 
                 mobile friendly and user friendly for both students and teachers. 
                 Our task was to analyse the already existing Fronter app for bugs and 
                 problems and fix the design solutions to come up with amazing ideas in the group. 
                 As a method we used the 5 day SPRINT method to increase our workflow and have everything ready on time.

                <p class="card-text">
                 This scroller website was a playfull atempt to have some fun with 
                 textures, code and css scrolling effects. The parallax is an emerging 
                 trend if you want to create something more interactive and fun for 
                 the user. As I have a collection of flowers and a saturated video to 
                 work with, why not go all the way and bring the full atmospheric effect? 
                 This is a desktop layout design used for testing a parallax effect therefore not mobile responsive.

              As part of the TH.0 team, my job was to design 
              a cutting edge and professional webpage that would result in a dynamic 
              prototype and also a series of graphic design material, 
              like logo's, banners, brochures and other. Climathon aims to unite people who possess an
              active interest in the environment and to encourage
              them to think creatively about solutions to climate
              change issues that are impacting their community.

              Cosmic Stryder, Anabolique & Adrenocrom are all name aliases AKA
              that have been used and are still in operation they define the
              different styles I create and branch into.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that different nuances are needed for different styles.
              Knowing how to adapt to them is a matter of flexibility and can
              prove to be a valuable asset.
