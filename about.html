      <p class=" about-me">
        My name is Nina Popovici, I am a dedicated fellow artist. Growing up I
        did taste art since early childhood when I started to imagine and draw
        the bedtime stories told by my parents and grandparents. At the
        beginning I have started small, on scrap paper, then in one day,
        exhausting all the pages, I was looking at the walls in my room, then
        with a smile and exploratory heart I dared to expand my visions on those
        4 immaculate “canvases”. </p>
        <p class=" about-me">I have created my own virtual world, timeless,
        with my heroes, unseen creatures and surreal, all imagined, deformed and
        transformed by my own understanding and imagination ... I have been in
        love with drawing ever since, as it offered me inner peace, smiles and
        serenity, things that the majority of us are craving. My background is
        mostly visual art, as I have been studying in schools with an art
        profile. The first environment was “Octav Bancila Highschool Of Visual
        Arts”, where I learned to sharpen my skills and perceive the qualities
        from the environment/subject.</p>
        <p class=" about-me"> After highschool was
        University, where I spent 3 years deepening the knowledge based in the
        highschool years followed by the discovery of new technologies and ways
        of working with visual media.

      <h1 class="fancy">Teaching others on my journey</h1>

      <p class=" about-me">
        I started working more with mural painting and getting a lot of
        commissions and clients, as self employed. After a while, one of the
        companies that I was painting for was a private school/nursing home and
        they needed a teacher for their kindergartens visual art classes.
         The potential behind this was quickly
        uncovered so I was offered many more hours and classes to conduct with
        different year students.</p>
        <p class=" about-me"> Visual
        communication and expression is a skill and was very important to teach
        by doing. That way, my students remembered the times they tried
        something new, failed and got frustrated and then, achieved amazing
        results by trying themselves. After these two years I had to relocate to
        Denmark and I left my teaching and painting job in Romania.</p>
        <p class=" about-me"> Learning a
        new language is another whole process in itself. Denmark offered me a
        new set of challenges as well as a new set of skills. Unlike other roles
        I had before, this time I had to branch out into the unknown and try my
        luck. I spent a lot of time studying the market for painting material
        prices, opportunities for exhibitions and projects.

      <h1 class="fancy">My relation with technology</h1>

      <p class=" about-me">
        I started using a computer at an early age and was fascinated when the
        internet appeared, as at the time I was playing computer games like Red
        alert, Warcraft, Starcraft, but most of all by the visual graphics, 
        which at the time were quite primitive. As the internet rolled in, we started communicating
        with people from other countries relatively easily, we managed to stream
        music online and see the very first internet web pages, basically
        learning a new way to communicate and think. </p>
        <p class=" about-me">I started using
        technologies like Adobe, became curious of colour schemes, gradients and the million ways you
        could play with an image. After highschool I kept my graphics profile and went on to study
        at “George Enescu University” where I began to go in-depth in working
        with many kinds of media. From hand-drawing to digital drawing and
        photography, graphic design and printing. Next up on my list was Illustrator. From
        drawing and concept to the actual design, where I could easily see many
        possible options with the click of a button. This took me to the next
        level, creatively. </p>
        <p class=" about-me">After a few years of working with Adobe and trying
        out Corel I got a job at a Printing company in London. Here, I applied
        the knowledge I had in university and I learned much more about
        printing, since my role was digital print operator. My job was to create
        simple designs for flyers, business cards, etc. Printing sounds easy but in order to create a
        good quality product, you must work very hard. This includes
        many attempts, from which I learned when I was in the 3 month training
        period. As curiosity took over me, I applied for the
        Multimedia program in Copenhagen where I would deepen my relationship
        with technology and learn how I can use my background to
        create innovative design solutions!

      <h1 class="fancy">What can I offer?</h1>
      
      <p class=" about-me">
           To improve
          the quality of design and bring innovative ideas to life. Also,
          finding solutions for the problems we are currently facing is our
          first priority and duty. </p>
         
          <p class=" about-me">
            My goal is creating new,
          efficient and pleasing aesthetic design solutions but also
          applications that can help our society and private lives thrive and
          overcome any hardship. My values are mutual respect and open
          communication, with the expectations laid out on the table. Respect
          for our planet and animals, by recycling and having environmentally
          friendly ideas to work with. Punctuality and consistency help me reach
          my greatest potential in work. I am a very flexible person if needed,
          but I prefer to have a fixed stable routine.</p>
     
      <p class=" about-me">
            My favourite digital tools are Adobe Cloud, HTML, CSS, a bit of JS. I
          would like to work with animation, character design, graphic design,
          maybe games. Editing, drawing,
          organising, writing and design is what I would prefer to do but I am
          open to learning new things.

              Cosmic Stryder, Anabolique & Adrenocrom are all name aliases AKA
              that have been used and are still in operation they define the
              different styles I create and branch into.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that different nuances are needed for different styles.
              Knowing how to adapt to them is a matter of flexibility and can
              prove to be a valuable asset.
