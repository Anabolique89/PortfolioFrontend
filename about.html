      <p class=" about-me">
        My name is Nina Popovici, I am a dedicated designer & artist. I 
        did taste art since early childhood when I started to imagine and draw
        the bedtime stories told by my parents and grandparents. At the
        beginning I started small, on scrap paper, then one day,
        exhausting all the pages, I was looking at the walls in my room, 
        with a smile and exploratory heart I dared to expand my visions on those
        4 immaculate “canvases”. </p>
        <p class=" about-me">I created my own virtual world, timeless,
        with my heroes, unseen creatures and surreal, all imagined, deformed and
        transformed by my own understanding and imagination ... I have been in
        love with drawing ever since, as it offered me inner peace and
        serenity. My background is mostly graphic design & visual art, as I 
        have been studying in schools with an art profile. The first environment 
        was “Octav Bancila College Of Visual Arts”, where I learned to sharpen my 
        visual skills and perceive the qualities from the environment. 
        We practiced digital & traditional graphic techniques.</p>
        <p class=" about-me"> After college was
        University, where I spent 3 years deepening the knowledge based in the
        college years followed by the discovery of new technologies and ways
        of working with visual media & digital tools.

      <p class=" about-me">
        I started working with mural painting and getting a lot of
        commissions and clients, as self employed. After a while, one of the
        companies that I was painting for that was a private school,
         needed a teacher for their kindergartens visual art classes.
         The potential behind this was quickly
        uncovered so I was offered many more hours and classes to conduct with
        different year students.</p>
        <p class=" about-me"> Visual
        communication and expression is a skill and was very important to teach
        by doing. That way, my students remembered the times they tried
        something new when they achieved amazing results themselves. 
        After these two years I had to relocate to
        Denmark and I left my teaching and mural job in Romania.</p>
        <p class=" about-me"> Learning a
        new language is another whole process in itself. Denmark offered me a
        new set of challenges as well as a new set of skills. Unlike other roles
        I had before, this time I had to branch out into the unknown and try my
        luck. I spent a lot of time researching the market for prices, opportunities, 
        exhibitions and projects.

      <h1 class="fancy">My relation with technology</h1>
      <hr class="light"/>
      <p class=" about-me">
        I started using a computer at an early age and was fascinated when the
        internet appeared, at the time I was playing computer games like Red
        Alert or Quake3, but most of all - the visual graphics, 
        which at the time were quite primitive. As the internet rolled in, we started communicating
        with people from overseas quite easily, we streamed
        music online and saw the very first internet web pages, basically
        learning a new way to communicate and think. </p>
        <p class=" about-me">I started using
        technologies like Photoshop, curious about colours, gradients and the million ways you
        could play with an image. After college I kept my graphic design profile and went on to study
        at “George Enescu University” where I began to go in-depth working
        with many kinds of media. From hand-drawing to digital drawing and
        photography, illustrations and editing. Next up on my list was Illustrator. From
        drawing and concept to the actual design, where I could easily create many
        possible options with a few clicks. This took me to the next
        level, creatively & digitally. </p>
        <p class=" about-me">After a few years of working with Adobe and Corel Draw I got 
          a job at a print shop in London. Here, I applied
        the skill I had from university and I learned much more about
        printing, and layout - as my role was digital print operator. 
        My job was to create
      simple designs for flyers, business cards, and many more. 
      Printing sounds easy but in order to create a
        good quality product, you must be focused.
         After a while, curiosity took over me and I enrolled in the
        Multimedia Design program in Copenhagen where I would deepen my relation
        with technology and learn how I can use my background to
        create innovative design solutions with modern technologies!

      <h1 class="fancy">What can I offer?</h1>
      <hr class="light"/>
          <p class=" about-me">
            My goal is creating new,
          efficient and pleasing aesthetic design solutions but also
          interfaces that can help our society thrive and
          overcome hardship. My values are mutual respect and open
          communication, with the expectations laid out on the table. Respect
          for our planet and animals, by recycling and having environmentally
          friendly ideas to work with. Punctuality and consistency help me reach
          my greatest potential in work. I am a flexible person,
          but I prefer to have a fixed stable routine.</p>
      <p class=" about-me">
           Another goal is to improve the quality of the web design that 
           can bring innovative ideas to life. Finding solutions for the problems 
           we are currently facing and coming together to create a better world. </p>
      <p class=" about-me">
            My favourite tools are Adobe XD, Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator,
           Figma, HTML, CSS and Github. I would like to work with animation, character design, graphic design, UX & UI Design and multimedia. 
          UX & UI design is what I would prefer to do but I am
          open to learning new things. 
          <br>
          I am experienced in working with frameworks like Bulma, Bootstrap, Npm, Parcel. 
          One of my favourite things is using Wordpress to create websites and I like keeping 
          my websites fully updated and functional.

              Cosmic Stryder, Anabolique & Adrenocrom are all name aliases AKA
              that have been used and are still in operation they define the
              different styles I create and branch into.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that different nuances are needed for different styles.
              Knowing how to adapt to them is a matter of flexibility and can
              prove to be a valuable asset.
