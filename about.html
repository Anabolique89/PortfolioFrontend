          My name is Nina Popovici, I am a dedicated fellow artist. Growing up I
          did taste art since early childhood when I started to imagine and draw
          the bedtime stories told by my parents and grandparents. At the
          beginning I have started small, on scrap paper, then in one day,
          exhausting all the pages, I was looking at the walls in my room, then
          with a smile and exploratory heart I dared to expand my visions on
          those 4 immaculate “canvases” . I have created my own virtual world,
          timeless, with my heroes, unseen creatures and surreal, all imagined,
          deformed and transformed by my own understanding and imagination ... I
          have been in love with drawing ever since, as it offered me inner
          peace, smiles and serenity, things that the majority of us are
          craving.

          My background is mostly visual art, as I have been studying in schools
          with an art profile. The first environment was “Octav Bancila
          Highschool Of Visual Arts”, where I learned to sharpen my skills and
          perceive the qualities from the environment/subject. Working with
          computers and doing a minimum of design was required in order to pass.
          Art history and languages added on while being inspired by different
          artists and art currents, were a way to expand my form of expression
          as an artist. After highschool was University, where I spent 3 years
          deepening the knowledge based in the highschool years followed by the
          discovery of new technologies and ways of working with visual media.

          I started working more with mural painting and getting a lot of
          commissions and clients, as self employed. After a while, one of the
          companies that I was painting for was a private school/nursing home
          and they needed a teacher for their kindergartens visual art classes.
          How to relate to children in an artistic environment tought me more
          about myself than I could have imagined. The potential behind this was
          quickly uncovered so I was offered many more hours and classes to
          conduct with different year teaching branches. So for two years I
          worked with groups of students that followed these postgraduate
          studies.

          Visual communication and expression is a skill and was very important
          to teach by doing. That way, my students remembered the times they
          tried something new, failed and got frustrated and then, achieved
          amazing results by trying themselves. After these two years I had to
          relocate to Denmark and I left my teaching and painting job in
          Romania. Learning a new language is another whole process in itself.
          Denmark offered me a new set of challenges as well as a new set of
          skills. Unlike other roles I had before, this time I had to branch out
          into the unknown and try my luck. I spent a lot of time studying the
          market for painting material prices, opportunities for exhibitions and
          projects.

      <h1 class="fancy">My relation with technology</h1>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p class="lead">
          I started using a computer at a early age and was fascinated when the
          internet appeared, as at the time I was playing computer games like
          Red alert, Warcraft, Starcraft, etc. I have been fascinated by
          strategy games, but most of all by the visual graphics, which at the
          time were quite primitive. As the internet rolled in, we started
          communicating with people from other countries relatively easily, we
          managed to stream music online and see the very first internet web
          pages, basically learning a new way to communicate and think. I
          started using technologies like Adobe, mostly for image manipulation
          and correction. I became curious of colour schemes, gradients and the
          million ways you could play with an image. Then we went on to writing
          media articles in school. After highschool I kept my graphics profile
          and went on to study at “George Enescu University” where I began to go
          in-depth in working with many kinds of media. From hand-drawing to
          digital drawing and photography, graphic design and printing, this was
          heaven for you if you were into art at the time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p class="lead">
          Next up on my list was Illustrator. From drawing and concept to the
          actual design, where I could easily see many possible options with the
          click of a button. This took me to the next level, creatively. After a
          few years of working with Adobe and trying out Corel I got a job at a
          Printing company in London. Here, I applied the knowledge I had in
          university and I learned much more about printing, since my role was
          digital print operator. My job was to create simple designs for
          flyers, business cards, etc, to print large posters, to adjust the
          machines. Printing sounds easy but in order to create a good quality
          product, you must work very hard and long. This includes many
          attempts, from which I learned when I was in the 3 month training
          period. I find printing fascinating now and I am working with many
          kinds of printing techniques. As curiosity took over me, I applied for
          the Multimedia program in Copenhagen where I would deepen my
          relationship with technology and learn a way in which I can use my
          background to create innovative design solutions!

          Services that make lives better, easier and more pleasant. To improve
          the quality of design and bring innovative ideas to life. Also,
          finding solutions for the problems we are currently facing is our
          first priority and duty. My goal is finding and creating new,
          efficient and pleasing aesthetic design solutions but also
          applications that can help our society and private lives thrive and
          overcome any hardship. My values are mutual respect and open
          communication, with the expectations laid out on the table. Respect
          for our planet and animals, by recycling and having environmentally
          friendly ideas to work with. Punctuality and consistency help me reach
          my greatest potential in work. I am a very flexible person if needed,
          but I prefer to have a fixed stable routine.

          My favourite digital tools are Adobe Cloud, HTML, CSS, a bit of JS. I
          would like to work with animation, character design, graphic design,
          maybe games. I have some issues implementing a Javascript focused
          website as I am trained more on the visual part of coding, like CSS or
          HTML but I can read JS code and understand it. Editing, drawing,
          organising, writing and design is what I would prefer to do but I am
          open to learning new things.

          What do I want to achieve? I want to show the world that each of us is
          capable of much more than we think. I want to test my ideas,
          collaborate and learn! I want to be recognised for my abilities and
          talents. To put them to good use, to contribute in creating a better
          life for myself and others.
